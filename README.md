# Consumer and Market Research

## Motivation 

In 2023, the gaming industry was worth about 250 billion dollars, with over 9 billion dollars in-game sales on Steam's mega platform and store.  It's a one-stop shop for viewing the most popular games and some important information about them. One of them is being able to identify how consumers view your product. In 2024, games come and go daily, and we see massive shifts in player bases. Player retention is a huge problem in the video game market; companies invest millions of dollars in game production and advertising, but player counts plummet after release. One of the best ways to produce a game that will have longevity is to understand what consumers liked and didn't like about games already released. We can make informed decisions about the historical performance of games and game genres through Steam product reviews. This can cater to an audience looking to get their hands on the next captivating product; we can learn what they want by listening to what they have to say. This project aims to dig up insights on valuable feedback about how previous games performed in the hands of the consumer. Highlighting areas that require improvement enhances product quality and boosts consumer trust and brand loyalty. In the increasingly growing and competitive video gaming industry, a good developer reputation for listening to their audience will go a long way. 

## Goals

Explore consumer ratings of different games and genres, highlighting important aspects of games that foster retention. 


### Project Objectives 

Analyze how consumer ratings trend over time for different models; this can highlight improvements in product delivery.  

Implement Natural Language Processing to identify keywords indicating product retention and gauge the overall sentiment of the game. 

Explore correlations between genres, consumer reports, and other factors such as age and flow.
