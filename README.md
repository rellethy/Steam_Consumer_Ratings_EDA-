# Consumer and Market Research

## Motivation 

Consumer reviews are a key indicator of a car producer's strengths and shortcomings. For a company to retain customers or bring back ex-customers, it's important to realize what draws a consumer to and away from your product. Car purchases are very heavily influenced by consumers future expectations of the product. For a consumer who cares about practicality, it's imporant that they can see themselves getting use from their vehicle down the line. By leveraging data from actual consumer reviews and experiences, this project aims to create an actionable reliability index that truly reflects the experiences of everyday users. This project offers a tool to make informed decisions based on the historical performance and satisfaction ratings of different car models. Understanding which cars have historically been reliable—and which have not—can save potential buyers from future headaches and unforeseen expenses. The insights derived from this analysis provide valuable feedback on how their vehicles perform in real-world conditions. Highlighting areas that require improvement can not only enhance product quality but also boost consumer trust and brand loyalty. In the increasingly competitive automotive industry, a reputation for reliability can be a significant differentiator.


## Goals
Explore consumer reports of different car brands and create central reports like overall brand reliability scores for consumers to account in their next car purchase, and for manufactures to identify shortcomings.

### Project Objectives 

Analyze how reliability and consumer ratings trend over time for different models, this can highlight improvments in product delivery.  

Implement Natural Language Processing to identify key words indicating reliability issues, as well as to gage the overall sentiment of the brand. 

Explore correlations between reliability scores, consumer reports and other factors such as age, and MSRP.
